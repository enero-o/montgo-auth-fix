## Instructions for the Job Candidate

As a job candidate, your task is to enhance the Auth Service by adding a feature that checks if the current user is signed in or not. Follow the steps below to complete this task:

1. Before making any modifications, ensure that the project is running successfully.

2. Locate the file or files responsible for handling user authentication.

3. Identify the appropriate functions or middleware that handle user sign-in or authentication status.

4. Implement a feature that checks if the current user is signed in or not. You may choose to add an API endpoint, middleware, or modify existing authentication functions.
